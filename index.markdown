## About Me
I am a second-year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University working with [Dr. Gregory Zelinsky](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/psychology/faculty/faculty_profiles/gzelinsky). 

My research interests are in the intersection of multimodal generative modelling and visual perception, focusing on building brain-inspired neural network architectures and generating human-aligned visual content.

## Publications
